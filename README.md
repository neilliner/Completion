##Story
The Sand Mandala is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition involving the meditative, ritualistic creation and destruction of mandalas made from colored sand. A sand mandala is ritualistically dismantled once it has been completed and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished to symbolize the Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life.[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala)

The idea of completing something just to know that it will disipate right after it is created is the epitomy of finishing something. It is an ancient and prolific lesson to artists who may never really feel a sense of completion. There is much ritual involved in destroying the magnificent mandala as there is in creating it. The cycle of life of a tondo inspired the team to create a multiplayer mandala creator. 

##Interactive Plan (may change)
Upon signing in each player will be granted a section of the mandala. Depending on how many users are signed in depends upon how large the section of the madala will be. All of the curves and or shapes will be loaded on the back end and randomly assigned to each user. Each section will be mirrored as well so it will hopefully stay symmetrical and perfect.
