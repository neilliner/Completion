MANDALA NOTES APRIL 30, 2015


100 y 0 on x

distance
between here and here so nothing goes outside of the circle
the third player would be this far away from player 2 and so on and so forth
conditionals
not random
follows the user

color pallettes
keeping the user on a certain path
soundcloud api

—————————-----------------------------------------------------------
user can use own song to change the movements
user feeds information 
the music will generate the shape
highs and lows
volume
Layers
Build 1 player layer

Two scenes
-Overview
-The one user 1 is drawing on


How does the player move around the scene?
Mouse control

Spiral 
Equidistant
streak around
mouse held down its going to draw two spirals
tapping you won’t notice
concentric circles
POV system
2 spirals that are spiraling on each other

Camera on a path
leave geometry behind
what does moving the mouse around do? what does holding it down? what does the keyboard do?

frequency can be the size of the circles
looking backwards
mouse moving around camera attached to it
click, new shape appears
math - heading of the camera, constrain camera to only look 45 degrees each way y-depth-gamify
overlapping geometry
click spacebar to pull up those options for ctrls
right click to see the entire mandala from user view
dropping something directly where i’m looking, set distance(could be random)
when the user 

set time
open-ended system, open-ended, infinite rules
respiral in
set number of loops 
the duration of the audio piece
song generates what shapes they are by the frequency
not just a spiral, not just a mandala, its a music visualizer
fine art or game?
drawing system will be unique overtime
whats the value add?


Drawing system

html drag and drop api, web audio

audio reacting, random number .5 or greater change to this camera angle

design it get colors

landing page to choose music
animation-live

landing page, end result
instructions on how to use it
Landing page on the about page, overview of the project

Pieces of the puzzle(pseudo-code):

CAMERA
camera determines where the shape will be drawn
Position
type of camera
get.position
what the camera is looking at
camera rotation= camera.position, camera.lookat camera.rotate
whats the position of the camera over time
moving on a spiral path
Positions:
overview
user view- does the user face different directions
spiral equals one job
Music will determine the shape 
Probability
Tied to time
Null object needs to look back at the spiral
Laying down points as you go, keep looking at the point behind it
Spiral, subtle

SHAPES
methods(class)
Position
rotation
primitives (groups)
shape.display(what is actually displaying?)
scene.Add(shape)

environment(atmosphere)


LOADER FOR GEOMETRY
